HTML Named Characters
---------------------

These are things like &nbsp; or &shy;. By default, PowerUI uses the HTML4 set.
If you want full coverage, the HTML5 set is provided here too.

The HTML5 set is not used by default because it's some 10 times bigger
and for the majority of users it would just amount to unnecessary bloat.

To use the HTML5 set:
- Go to Window -> PowerUI -> Named Characters
- Tick the HTML5 set box.
