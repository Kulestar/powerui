	This example shows how to hook up mousedown events from C#. You can do the same with keydown/up, too. Each element defines e.g. OnMouseDown that you can hook on to. Alternatively, use your C# class name to point e.g. onmousedown directly at a C# function, such as onmousedown="CSharpExample.Direct". JavaScript may instead be used with e.g. onmousedown="jsFunction()".

	<div id='illBeClickable' onmousedown='CSharpExample.Direct'>
		This is a DIV and it's clickable but its mousedown points directly at a C# function.

	<!-- "Category" attribute (doesn't have to be category - it can be anything you want if it's needed) is used to identify which was actually clicked. -->
	<h4 category="fruits">
	This is the Fruits Header (all are clickable).

	<h4 category="veggies">
