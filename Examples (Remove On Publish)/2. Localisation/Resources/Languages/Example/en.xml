<var name="LocalizationIntro">
	Localization lets you <i>globalize</i> your game so that it can be understood in lots of different languages. 
	Text is loaded from the <b>Languages/</b> folder and is used with a <b>&amp;Variable;</b> in your html. 
	Usually <b>Groups</b> are used like <b>&amp;GroupName.Variable;</b> which come from Languages/GroupName/ instead.
	Text can optionally be <b>gender specific</b>. This is useful when you want to address the player with he or she.
	<br>
	<br>
	Localization can also be used to set on screen variables which update wherever they've been used on the screen. 
	<b>Here's a variable example</b> - In this case, the username is the variable.
