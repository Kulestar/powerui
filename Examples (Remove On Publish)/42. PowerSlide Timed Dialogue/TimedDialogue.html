	<b>Using PowerSlide for dialogue (speech) - Cutscene style</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Here's an example of some dialogue which is automatically cued - it supports audio files (either as a single audio clip for the whole track, or individual clips per dialogue slide to also support player cues). It uses the 'subtitles' template seen in the previous example.
