	<b>Using PowerSlide for dialogue (speech)</b>
	<br>
	There's so many ways to display dialogue, so 
	PowerSlide has been designed to be <a href='http://powerui.kulestar.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dialogue'>as flexible as possible</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
	Here's an example of some dialogue which is cued by the player and uses a template called "subtitles" which you'll also find in this example's files.
	<br>
	<br>
	<input type='button' id='starter' value='Start talking to Joey!'>
