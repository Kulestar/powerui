PowerUI's text system, InfiniText, loads font files directly. This allows it to have full knowledge
of the shapes within the font file and, as a result, generate these awesome 3D text objects entirely
at runtime. They're tied into the CSS system so you get the complete power of PowerUI's
layout engine - they can be animated, plus they localise too!

To use, simply add:

text-extrude:{a number; the world space extrusion amount}

To your CSS, like this:

text-extrude:3;


If you need to apply a custom shader, use the shader-family CSS property and provide an Extrude shader.
