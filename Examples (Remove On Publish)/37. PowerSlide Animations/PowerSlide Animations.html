	PowerSlide is used to declare <b>sequences of things</b>. It's great for animations and dialogue (speech between people). 
	<br>
	<br>
	This example <i>(inspired by SimCity)</i> shows PowerSlide being used to create a series of animations - check it out!
	<br>
	<br>
	<input type='button' id='starter' value='Run PowerSlide!'/>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>A quick note about competing selectors:</b> If you have a selector "untriggering" whilst an animation is playing, it will cause a style refresh which 'wins' and drops the animation. For example, when an <b>active</b> selector no longer matches an element and it untriggers, an animation on that element may be cancelled. This will be getting attention in the future.
	<!-- mousedown method is declared over in MyPowerSlideAnimations.cs -->

	<!--
		In this example, we're hardcoding the values of the tip bar.
		You could use C#, localisation or both to set the values.

			PowerSlide can be used in a variety of ways, and we're also working on a free, open source editor to generate the json files that it uses too.
			<br>
			Take a look at <b>PowerSlideExample.json</b> - the file that actually runs - and <b>AnnotatedPowerSlideExample.json</b> - which describes what's going on.
