PowerTools API
--------------

This is a JSON REST API which is intended to be implemented by
webservers hosting a copy of PowerTools. It's also implemented here 
in the Unity Editor for consistency.


This way, whenever someone wants to make a quick change, they can just pop 
open PowerTools on e.g. their tablet, make their changes, then save it, and it'll all continue to be tracked by version control. 
You could then also provide access to, for example, remote translators who can use their browser to touch up your localisation 
without needing to give them your whole Unity project. The possibilities are very interesting so your feedback would be much appreciated!

What does it do?
----------------

Let's say you've uploaded PowerTools to your webserver. 
Your team members can then start using it wherever they have internet access. 
However, when they want to actually save their work, that file needs to go somewhere. 
Similarly, they'll want to explore files available in the project too.
That's where this API is used. Your webserver (and the Unity Editor) have a REST API
which, for example, lists all PowerSlide timelines in the project so they can be edited.

Web API implementation
----------------------

We're planning on implementing this in PHP and also having 
options to store the actual files in a GIT repository.
